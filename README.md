- LR Exercise
## LR Exercise
This is an exercise designed to help with the coordination of the left and right hemispheres, where a screen will alternate (or reiterate) periodically the letters "R" or "L" indicating that the individual doing the exercise will switch the direction of motion. One first makes a motion with both of their pointer fingers, usually in circles in the air for beginners, and then as the letters appear on the screen, accompanied by a beeping sound, the user switches the direction of only the left or right finger, depending on the output to the screen.
